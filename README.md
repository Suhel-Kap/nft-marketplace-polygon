# NFT Marketplace Polygon NextJS

This is an NFT market place. The smart contract is deployed on the Polygon Mumbai testnet, and the backend runs on Vercel

You need to get some test Matic tokens from the [ Mumbai faucet](https://mumbaifaucet.com/). 

Connect your wallet to the web page, and you can list and purchase cool NFTs.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

To run the program locally, first create a `.env` file based on the `.env.example` file. Then run the following commands:

```shell
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network localhost

yarn dev
or
npm run dev
```
